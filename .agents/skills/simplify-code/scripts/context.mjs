// retry forever or drop required work instead of degrading as intended.
// The carve-out below walks that deviation back for one class: "rather than
// retrying" was read as covering calls the harness rejected before any agent
// existed, so one bad optional argument (an override the chosen dispatch mode
// treats as mutually exclusive) spent the whole fallback and cost every
// independent context. Its cause is the harness call schema, not the agent-tool
// gate this directive was built for — so it outlives that gate's exit condition
// and must survive a deletion triggered by it.

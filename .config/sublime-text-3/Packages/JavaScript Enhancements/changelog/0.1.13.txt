** WHAT IS THIS? **
===================

This plugin uses Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook) under the hood.

It offers better javascript autocomplete and a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular v1 and v2 projects
- React projects
- Express projects
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript real-time errors
- etc.

You could use it also in existing projects (see the Wiki - https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki/Using-it-with-an-existing-project)!

It turns Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!

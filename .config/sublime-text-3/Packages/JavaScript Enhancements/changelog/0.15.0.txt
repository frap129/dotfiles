=================================================================
** THIS PLUGIN IS IN BETA! Thanks for your support in advance! **
=================================================================

If you like it, remember to star it ⭐ on GitHub: https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements

** USAGE **
===========

See how it works on the Wiki: 👉👉 https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki 👈👈


** WHAT IS THIS? **
===================

This plugin uses Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook) under the hood.

It offers better javascript autocomplete and a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 (it includes also v3) projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular v1 and v2 (it includes also v4 and v5) projects
- React projects (only about the creation at this moment)
- React Native projects (only about the creation at this moment. I will add also NativeScript support)
- Express projects (only about the creation at this moment)
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript real-time errors
- Code Refactoring
- etc.

You could use it also in existing projects (see the Wiki - https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki/Using-it-with-an-existing-project)!

It turns Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!

This project is based on my other Sublime Text plugin JavaScript Completions (https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScript-Completions)

** NOTE **
If you want use this plugin, you may want uninstall/disable the JavaScript Completions plugin, if installed.

** OS SUPPORTED **
==================

👉 Linux (64-bit)
👉 Mac OS X 
👉 Windows (64-bit): released without the use of TerminalView plugin. For each feature (like also creating a project) will be used the cmd.exe shell (so during the creation of a project don't close it until it finishes!). Unfortunately the TerminalView plugin supports only Linux-based OS 😞. Has someone any advice or idea about that? Is there something similar to the TerminalView plugin for Windows?? Thanks!

❗❗ Dependencies ❗❗
=======================

In order to work properly, this plugin has some dependencies:

👉 Sublime Text 3 (build 3124 or newer)
👉 Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org or nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
👉 TerminalView (only for Linux and Mac OS X) sublime text plugin (https://github.com/Wramberg/TerminalView)

Not required, but useful for typescript files (Flow wont work on this type of files):

👉 TypeScript sublime text plugin (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin) 

** Flow Requirements **
=======================

It use [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) for type checking and auto-completions.

👉 Mac OS X
👉 Linux (64-bit)
👉 Windows (64-bit)

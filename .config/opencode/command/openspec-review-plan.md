description: Review an openspec change proposal before applying
---

# Guardrails

- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `openspec/` directory—run `ls openspec` or `openspec update` if you don't see it) if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.

# Task

Review the attached change proposal and validate that the plan is consistent with the proposal. You MUST use the code-reasoning
tool to deeply and critically consider the plan for each task. Verify that each task follows existing spec requirements, or is
covered by a spec-delta in the change proposal. Validate that the spec deltas are valid, given the intended changes. Start your task
by making a TODO list, update and follow it throughout your investigation.

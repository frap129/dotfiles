description: How this machine's Hindsight coding-agent memory works — the plugin behind the 🧠 banner. Use when the user says "store/remember this in hindsight", asks what the memory/knowledge pages are, wants to configure per-repo memory (disable, rename banks, git depth), or something memory-related looks broken.

# Hindsight Coding-Agent Memory

This machine runs the `hindsight-coding-agents` plugin: long-term project memory for coding
sessions, backed by a Hindsight server. You (the agent) are already wired into it — this skill
explains what happens automatically, which tools you have, and how to configure or debug it.

## What happens automatically (no action needed)

- **Per-repo memory bank**: each repository resolves to a bank (shown in the session banner:
  `↳ memory bank “coding-agent::<repo>”`). Worktrees share the main repo's bank.
- **Ingestion builds itself**: on first open, the bank is seeded from recent commit messages and a
  read-only codebase survey; every session start, a background engine tops it up (new commits, new
  conversations) and keeps 5 knowledge pages current. There is NO ingest command to run.
- **Session synthesis**: by default, the first prompt of a session triggers one deep memory
  synthesis (`reflect`) injected into context. `autoInject` switches the source: `pages` (knowledge
  page search hits), `recall` (recalled observations), or `none` (nothing injected; the agent
  searches the knowledge pages first and reflects only when they are too shallow).
- **Write-back**: the session transcript is retained into the bank automatically at session end
  (per-turn on opencode). The user never needs to "save" a conversation.

## Storing things deliberately

When the user says "store this in hindsight" / "remember this":

- The **current conversation** is captured automatically at session end — say so; no tool needed.
- An **external document, notes, or durable findings** → `hindsight_ingest_document(title, content)`.
- A **new feature/initiative being started** → `hindsight_capture_initiative(title, summary)`,
  right after the plan is agreed and before code is written.
- A **plan that materially changed** (goal, scope, or rationale — including mid-implementation) →
  call `hindsight_capture_initiative` again with `relates_to_page_id` set to that initiative's page
  id, summarising the _current_ intent. Same page, updated plan — never a second page. Trivial
  course-corrections don't count.

## Retrieving

- `hindsight_search_knowledge_pages(query)` — FIRST STOP for project questions (components,
  conventions, past decisions, initiatives). Server-side hybrid search, fast.
- `hindsight_read_knowledge_page(page_id)` / `hindsight_list_knowledge_pages` — read pages fully.
- `hindsight_reflect(query)` — deep reasoning over the whole memory for WHY questions and exact
  decided values; slower (seconds), use deliberately.
- Credit visibly whenever memory informs an answer: start that part with
  `🧠 From Hindsight memory (<page>): …` — and never credit memory that didn't contribute.

## Correcting wrong or stale memory

If you verify that something Hindsight served is wrong or outdated (the code, git, or an external
source contradicts it), FIX THE RECORD — don't just ignore it. Call
`hindsight_ingest_document` with:

- **title**: `Correction: <topic>` (e.g. `Correction: retry policy 4xx set`)
- **content**: (1) what memory claimed, (2) what is verifiably true now, (3) the evidence you
  checked (file/commit/output). Quote exact values verbatim.

Newer facts supersede older ones in retrieval, so one clear correction permanently outranks the
stale memory. Do this whenever you catch a wrong injected memory, a stale knowledge-page claim, or
an outdated decision — silent disregard leaves the trap armed for the next session.

## Install / update

```bash
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents install all          # every detected agent, wired natively
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code  # or just one
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents uninstall all        # removes exactly what install added
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents update               # refresh the runtime only, no rewiring
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents stats                # how often each agent uses Hindsight
```

`install` takes an explicit target — `all`, or one or more harness names. A bare
`npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents install` changes nothing and prints the choice, so wiring every agent on
the machine is never something that happens by accident. **Updating is the same `install`
command again** — it re-copies the runtime in place.

Day to day you should not have to: once a day, a session start checks npm and re-stages a newer
runtime in the background (`autoUpdate`, on by default — set it to `false` to pin the version you
have). That is the `update` command above, which refreshes the copy every wired agent already
points at and deliberately touches no host config; re-run `install` yourself after a release that
adds a new hook, or to wire another agent.

## Local daemon settings (daemon mode)

Daemon settings keep the names the old per-agent Claude Code plugin used, so an existing
environment carries over unchanged:

| field               | env                             | default        | meaning                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serverMode`        | `HINDSIGHT_SERVER_MODE`         | `cloud`        | `cloud` \| `self-hosted` \| `daemon`                       |
| `apiPort`           | `HINDSIGHT_API_PORT`            | `9077`         | port the local daemon listens on                           |
| `daemonIdleTimeout` | `HINDSIGHT_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | —              | deprecated, ignored: the daemon no longer exits on its own |
| `daemonProfile`     | `HINDSIGHT_DAEMON_PROFILE`      | `coding-agent` | which local database it uses                               |
| `embedVersion`      | `HINDSIGHT_EMBED_VERSION`       | `latest`       | which `hindsight-embed` release to run                     |
| `embedPackagePath`  | `HINDSIGHT_EMBED_PACKAGE_PATH`  | —              | run a local checkout instead (development)                 |

Any `HINDSIGHT_API_*` variable you export is forwarded to the daemon, so server-side settings need
no equivalent here.

## Configuration

Configuration is **one JSON file**: `~/.hindsight/coding-agent.json`. Layering, later wins per field:

1. built-in defaults
2. environment variables — `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN`, and one per scalar setting
   (`HINDSIGHT_<FIELD_IN_CAPS>`), for containers and CI that inject config rather than write a file
3. the file's top level
4. its `harnesses.<name>` section — per-agent override
5. its `banks.<resolvedBankId>` section — per-repo override, applied after the bank is resolved
   (see [Per-repo opt-in/out](#per-repo-opt-inout--banksbankid))

Environment variables are a **fallback**: the file wins wherever it sets a value, so adding env to
an existing setup changes nothing. The two list-valued settings, `retainTags` and `optInPaths`, take
a comma-separated value (`HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_TAGS="project:{gitProject},env:work"`); entries are
trimmed and blanks dropped.
The map-valued settings (`mapPathToBank`, `harnesses`, `banks`, `retainMetadata`) are file-only —
per-key branching doesn't survive flattening into one variable. `maxParallelRetains` is available
as `HINDSIGHT_MAX_PARALLEL_RETAINS` for containers and CI.

`HINDSIGHT_CONFIG` moves the file itself — point it at another path for a container or a test
harness where `$HOME` is not the right anchor. It is still exactly one file; only its location
changes. (The other variables that are not settings are `HINDSIGHT_LOG_FILE`, `HINDSIGHT_DIAG_FILE`,
`HINDSIGHT_USAGE_FILE` and `HINDSIGHT_LOG_LEVEL` — see [Diagnostics & logging](#diagnostics--logging).)

### When a change takes effect

Config is read when a process starts — the file is not watched — so when an edit applies depends on
what reads it:

| host                                                                                                        | reads the file                                                      | an edit applies            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| hook harnesses (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Grok Build, Antigravity CLI, Devin) | once per hook invocation — each hook is its own short-lived process | on your next prompt        |
| persistent plugins (opencode, opencode 2, Kilo CLI, Cline CLI, pi, Prime Agent, DeepSeek Harness)           | once per workspace, when the host loads the plugin                  | after restarting the agent |
| the MCP server behind the `hindsight_*` tools                                                               | once at startup                                                     | in your next session       |

`apiToken` is the exception. Every host re-reads it when the server rejects a request, so enabling
authentication or rotating the key is picked up on the next call with nothing to restart —
otherwise a rotation would leave a long-running agent failing every memory call until it was
restarted. Everything else follows the table: `apiUrl`, `disabled`, bank routing, `gitIngest`, and
the survey and knowledge-page settings.

`hindsight_diagnose` reports both sides of that gap — what the file says now, and what the running
client is actually using.

### Opt-in only

By default every project gets memory — that is what makes the plugin zero-setup. If you would
rather nothing be remembered until you say so, turn memory off everywhere and name the projects
that may use it:

```jsonc
{
  "optInOnly": true,
  "optInPaths": ["~/work/client-x", "~/oss"],
}
```

Anything outside those paths is **inert**: no bank is created, nothing is retained, no seed runs,
and the agent behaves exactly as it would without the plugin. Approving costs nothing else —
`optInPaths` says _which projects_, not _which bank_, so an approved repo keeps its usual
`coding-agent::{gitProject}` name. Paths are prefixes, so approving `~/work` approves every repo
under it while each still gets its own bank.

A `mapPathToBank` entry counts as opted in too, since routing a path to a named bank already
declares that project. A bare `bankId` does not: it names a bank rather than a project, so it
cannot say which work may be remembered, and a privacy switch has to fail closed.

There is no per-repo opt-in file, for the same reason there is no repo-carried config at all: a
cloned repository must not be able to turn memory on.

There is deliberately no repo-carried config file — per-repo bank routing is `mapPathToBank`,
per-agent differences are `harnesses.<name>`.

Each entry point knows which harness it _is_ (the opencode plugin is loaded by opencode, the codex
hook by Codex...), so one shared config serves several agents side by side:

```jsonc
{
  "apiUrl": "https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io",
  "harnesses": {
    "opencode": { "reflectTimeoutMs": 60000 },
    "claude-code": { "disabled": true }, // e.g. memory off for Claude only
  },
}
```

Keys are the API's own recall parameters, passed straight through, so anything recall accepts is settable without a new option here; `query` is the one field it cannot replace. The default body is `{"types": ["observation"], "budget": "low", "max_tokens": 2000, "include": {"entities": null}}`, and what you set is merged over it one key at a time — `{"max_tokens": 4000}` changes the budget and leaves the rest alone. Observations are the consolidated layer, so they answer best per token, but a bank with **consolidation disabled never grows any** and the default recall comes back empty on it: set `{"types": ["world", "experience"]}` there, or `{"types": null}` for every type.

Maps to the page's `trigger.refresh_cron`, or `trigger.refresh_after_consolidation` in the Hindsight API (`true` for auto-refresh, `false` for manual)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `pageTriggerCron`       | `"H * * * *"`                        | schedule for `pageTriggerType: "cron"` — UTC, standard 5-field cron, e.g. `"0 3 * * *"`. The default is hourly, each page on its own hashed minute. Sets the page's `trigger.refresh_cron`, which the API treats as mutually exclusive with `refresh_after_consolidation`; a scheduled refresh is skipped when nothing changed. Write a field as `H` to give each page its own value there — see **Spreading refreshes with `H`** below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `pages`                 | every page                           | per-page configuration for the seeded knowledge pages, keyed by page name (case-insensitive): `false` skips a page entirely, `{"source_query": "..."}` seeds it with your question instead of the built-in one. Omitted, all five pages are seeded with their built-in queries. This is the supported way to own a page's wording — the plugin re-syncs a page whose live query differs from the one it is configured to have, so a query edited through the API or the control plane is replaced on the next session. A skipped page is **not deleted**: one already seeded keeps its content and stops being re-synced. The scoping clause is appended to your query too, so a reworded page cannot start reporting a dependency's decisions as this project's. File-only, like `recallOptions`; in a `banks.<id>` section it replaces the global map rather than merging into it                             |
| `customPages`           | —                                    | knowledge pages of your own, seeded alongside the five above and keyed by the name they get: `{"Security posture": {"source_query": "...", "tags": ["knowledge:decision"]}}`. `source_query` is required; `tags` picks which facts feed the page and is optional — omitted, the page draws on everything the bank holds. A separate setting from `pages` on purpose, so that an unknown name there stays a typo warning rather than quietly creating a page. File-only, and replaced (not merged) by a `banks.<id>` section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

By default a page refreshes **hourly, staggered**: `pageTriggerCron` is `"H * * * *"`, so every
page gets its own minute of the hour (see below) and a tick with nothing new to fold in is skipped
server-side. That keeps pages within an hour of the repo without paying auto-refresh's price — one
LLM synthesis per page per consolidation, on a repo that consolidates all day. Set
`pageTriggerType: "auto-refresh"` to go back to refreshing on every consolidation.

`pageTriggerType`/`pageTriggerCron` decide only **when** a page refreshes. **How** it refreshes
belongs to the server: Hindsight creates a knowledge page with a delta refresh (each pass edits the
page instead of rebuilding it) that doesn't reflect over sibling pages, and these settings merge
over those defaults rather than replacing them.

### Spreading refreshes with `H`

One `pageTriggerCron` is shared by every page in every repo you point this plugin at. So a literal
`"0 3 * * *"` does not schedule _a_ refresh at 03:00 — it schedules **all** of them at 03:00, five
pages per bank, on the same worker pool that serves retain. A session ingesting at 03:0x queues
behind the pile, and moving the hour just moves the pile.

Write a field as `H` and it is replaced, per page, by a value hashed from the bank id and the page
name. Each page gets its own slot, the same slot on every run:

| `pageTriggerCron`  | what each page gets                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"H H * * *"`      | once a day, at its own minute and hour                 |
| `"H * * * *"`      | once an hour, at its own minute                        |
| `"H 3 * * *"`      | daily at 03:MM — spread inside the hour you chose      |
| `"H H(0-5) * * *"` | daily, spread across 00:00–05:59 only                  |
| `"0 3 * * *"`      | no `H`, no hashing — exactly what it says, all at once |

`H` is [Jenkins' syntax](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#cron-syntax) for the same
problem. It never reaches the API: the plugin resolves it to an ordinary cron expression
(`"41 17 * * *"`) when it creates the page, so the schedule you see in the control plane is a plain
one you can edit. Hashing spreads pages out, it does not partition them — two pages can still land
on the same minute, just not all of them.

**These settings apply to the pages a repo already has, too.** Every session compares each page
this plugin created — the seeded taxonomy and every captured initiative — against the config and
re-syncs the ones that differ, so a bank seeded before this default changed moves onto the hourly
schedule by itself, and a page you retriggered by hand in the control plane is put back on the
configured policy the next time an agent runs. The config
file is the source of truth for these pages: to give one a different schedule, change
`pageTriggerType`/`pageTriggerCron` (per bank, if it is only that repo) rather than editing the
page. Only the fields this plugin states are touched — a page's `mode`, its excluded siblings and
its minimum refresh interval are left exactly as they are.

### Customize Knowledge Pages — `pages`

Every repo gets the same five pages. They are a **taxonomy**, not a summary of your source: each one
is synthesized from what the bank ingested — commit history and past conversations — and each is
pinned to one knowledge tier, so a page draws only on the facts the extractor routed to it.

| Page                           | What it answers                                                                                         | Tier tag                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Component map`                | the main components/modules/subsystems, what each is responsible for, and how they depend on each other | `knowledge:component`    |
| `Core concepts`                | the domain abstractions and key entities — the vocabulary a developer has to know                       | `knowledge:concept`      |
| `Conventions and patterns`     | how THIS project does things: testing, error handling, naming, structure, how changes are made          | `knowledge:convention`   |
| `Key decisions and rationale`  | the significant technical decisions and the durable "why we do it this way" behind them                 | `knowledge:decision`     |
| `Initiatives and enhancements` | the major initiatives and features over time, linking out to each captured initiative's own page        | `knowledge:feature-work` |

`pages` says which of them to seed and what each one asks. Keys are the page names above, matched
ignoring case and surrounding spaces:

```jsonc
{
  "pages": {
    // don't seed this page at all
    "Component map": false,
    // seed it, but ask your question instead of the built-in one
    "Key decisions and rationale": {
      "source_query": "What did we decide about data retention, encryption and PII handling, and why? Prefer decisions that constrain what new code may do.",
    },
  },
}
```

Omit `pages` entirely — the default — and all five are seeded with their built-in queries.

**Fewer pages.** Each page costs one LLM synthesis per refresh, so a repo that only wants the
architecture ones turns the rest off:

```jsonc
{
  "pages": {
    "Initiatives and enhancements": false,
    "Conventions and patterns": false,
    "Key decisions and rationale": false,
  },
}
```

**Per repo**, like every other field — usually where this belongs, since what a page should ask is a
property of the project, not of your machine:

```jsonc
{
  "banks": {
    "coding-agent::payments-api": {
      "pages": {
        "Core concepts": {
          "source_query": "What are the payment domain's entities — orders, ledgers, settlement states — and what does each mean in OUR model?",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Four things worth knowing before you reach for it:

- **This is the only durable way to reword a page.** Every session compares each seeded page against
  the query it is configured to have and re-syncs the ones that differ, so a `source_query` edited
  through the API or the control plane is replaced the next time an agent runs. Setting it here makes
  your wording the configured one. When a re-sync does replace a query, the plugin now says which
  page in the plugin log rather than doing it silently.
- **Your query still gets the scoping clause.** The sentence that keeps a dependency's decisions off
  your project's page is appended to a custom query too — a bank holds facts about the libraries and
  services a repo merely uses, and without that clause a page will present them as yours.
- **The tier tag stays the taxonomy's.** It selects which facts the synthesis reads; rewording the
  question changes what is asked of those facts, not which ones are in scope.
- **`false` does not delete anything.** A page already seeded keeps its content and simply stops
  being re-synced — remove it in the control plane if you want it gone.

A name that matches no page above is ignored with a warning in the plugin log, so a typo fails
loudly instead of looking like it disabled something. Adding pages of your own is not what this
setting is for: the agent's `hindsight_capture_initiative` tool already creates pages, one per
initiative, each with its own query.

#### Pages of your own — `customPages`

`pages` only reworks the five above. To add a page, name it under `customPages`:

```jsonc
{
  "customPages": {
    "Security posture": {
      "source_query": "What are this project's security decisions — authn, secrets handling, PII, dependency policy — and what do they constrain in new code?",
      "tags": ["knowledge:decision"],
    },
    "Operational runbook": {
      "source_query": "How does this project get deployed, monitored and rolled back? What has broken in production, and what fixed it?",
    },
  },
}
```

`source_query` is required. `tags` is optional and picks which facts feed the page — one of the tier
tags above, or any tag you stamp on your own writes with `retainTags`. Omit it and the page draws on
everything the bank holds: a refresh matches tags with `all`, so no tags means no tag constraint,
**not** an empty page.

Your pages are seeded at the same root as the taxonomy, on the same refresh schedule, and re-synced
from the config the same way — reword one here and the live page follows on the next session. They
compose with `pages`, so trading two built-ins for one of your own is just both settings at once.

**Why it is a separate setting.** `pages` refuses a name that matches no seeded page, and that is
what makes a typo loud: if an unknown key there meant "create this page", `"Componnet map"` would
quietly create an empty second page instead of rewording the one you meant. For the same reason,
naming a seeded page under `customPages` is refused — reword it under `pages`.

A page you create yourself in the control plane is a third thing again, and the plugin never touches
it: the seed pass only visits the pages it is configured to own.

### A bank you shape yourself — `manageBankConfig`

Pointed at a bank, this plugin gives it the shape its ingestion needs: retain strategies for the
kinds of document it writes (`git`, `gitlog`, `conversation`, `document`, `survey`), a `knowledge`
entity-label group that routes facts to the knowledge pages, and — on a bank that has no missions of
its own — the coding missions.

**It only ever adds what is missing.** A strategy you defined, an edit you made to one of the
plugin's, a reworded label group, a mission you rewrote in the control plane: each is left exactly
as it is, on every session, forever. What the bank already says wins. The cost of that promise is
that a plugin release which _rewords_ an existing strategy or label does not reach a bank that
already has it. To take the current default back, clear that override on the bank (delete the
strategy, or the whole `retain_strategies` entry, in the control plane): the next session finds the
bank silent there and seeds it again.

One field is the exception: the extraction mode of the plugin's own four strategies (`git`,
`gitlog`, `conversation`, `document`) follows `retainExtractionMode` and is put back on every session
if it drifts — the same way a seeded page's query is. Change it in `coding-agent.json`, not in the
control plane. The strategies' other fields, and your own strategies, are still left alone.

Set `manageBankConfig: false` to keep the plugin out of the bank's configuration altogether — the
right setting for a bank you share with non-coding work, or one you configure yourself. That bank
should then define the five strategies above itself. Note that the miss is **silent**: the server
does not reject a retain naming a strategy the bank lacks, it logs a warning and extracts with the
bank's own configuration — so a commit diff, a session transcript and a survey marker would all get
the same generic treatment instead of the extraction each needs. Knowledge pages are seeded either
way; `pageTriggerType` governs what they cost.

Like every field here it can be set per bank, which is usually where it belongs:

```json
{
  "bankId": "my-global-bank",
  "banks": { "my-global-bank": { "manageBankConfig": false } }
}
```

### Per-repo opt-in/out — `banks.<bankId>`

Per-repo control lives in the SAME file, keyed by the **resolved bank id** (shown in the session
banner) and applied AFTER bank resolution — so it works regardless of where the repo lives, and
survives directory moves:

```jsonc
{
  "banks": {
    "coding-agent::secret-client": { "disabled": true }, // blacklist: no memory at all
    "coding-agent::old-name": { "bank": "team::shared" }, // rename / converge banks
    "coding-agent::big-mono": { "gitIngest": "full", "retainSessions": false },
  },
}
```

Any behavioral field can be overridden per bank, and `bank` **renames the destination** (single
hop: the section is selected by the resolved id, the target is literal — several ids may converge
on one shared bank, and the target's own section is not consulted). Other bank-resolution fields
are ignored inside a bank section.

#### Recipe: two repos, one shared bank

Two ways, by what the natural key is:

**By resolved id** — you know the repo names; works wherever the repos live (and keeps working if
they move). Both ids converge on one literal target:

```jsonc
{
  "banks": {
    "coding-agent::backend": { "bank": "team::product" },
    "coding-agent::frontend": { "bank": "team::product" },
  },
}
```

**By path prefix** — the repos live under one directory; a single `mapPathToBank` entry covers
every repo (present and future) beneath it:

```jsonc
{
  "mapPathToBank": { "/Users/me/work/client-x": "client-x-memory" },
}
```

Rule of thumb: converge by **id** for a hand-picked set of repos; map by **path** when a folder is
the boundary ("everything I clone under `work/client-x` shares memory").

### Bank resolution

Coding memory is **per repository**. Resolution order for the working directory:

1. `mapPathToBank` — longest matching absolute-path prefix (mapping a repo root covers every
   subdirectory; deeper mappings win; overrides even an explicit `bankId`).
2. Static — `bankId` set (or `dynamicBankId: false`).
3. Dynamic — `bankIdTemplate` with placeholders:
   - `{gitProject}` — worktree-aware repo name: `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves every
     linked worktree to the **main** worktree's basename, so all worktrees of a repo share one bank
     (bare repos use the bare dir name). **Outside a repo** there is nothing for git to resolve, so
     it falls back to the basename of the directory the **session started in** — an agent that
     `cd`s into a subdirectory keeps writing to one bank, and a subdirectory gets its own bank only
     when you deliberately start a session there
   - `{project}` — plain working-directory basename
   - `{harness}` — the entry point asking (`opencode`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `antigravity-cli`, `cursor-cli`, `copilot-cli`)
   - `{channel}` / `{user}` — `$HINDSIGHT_CHANNEL_ID` / `$HINDSIGHT_USER_ID`

The default `"coding-agent::{gitProject}"` is **harness-neutral**, so opencode, Claude Code, and Codex
all share one memory per repo — use `"{harness}-{gitProject}"` to split per agent instead.

### Recording where a memory came from

With a bank per repo, the bank _is_ the answer to "where did this come from". On a deliberately
**shared** bank — one bank holding cross-project knowledge so facts recall everywhere — it isn't:
every memory looks alike. `retainTags` and `retainMetadata` stamp that provenance onto conversations,
git history and diffs, survey lifecycle documents, initiative markers, and documents saved through
`hindsight_ingest_document`:

```jsonc
{
  "bankId": "shared", // one bank for everything
  "retainTags": ["project:{gitProject}", "env:work"],
  "retainMetadata": { "repo": "{gitProject}" },
}
```

Recalls can then filter by `project:<repo>`, and every document shows which repository it came out
of. Both accept the same placeholders as `bankIdTemplate` — `{gitProject}`, `{project}`,
`{harness}`, `{channel}`, `{user}` — plus `{bankId}`, `{sessionId}` and `{timestamp}`.
`{gitProject}` is worktree-aware here too, so every linked worktree of a repo stamps one name.
`{sessionId}` resolves to `unknown` for documents that do not originate from an agent session.

The plugin's own `source:` and `harness:` tags are reserved: entries in those namespaces are ignored
with a warning, so a document's agent attribution always reflects the agent that actually wrote it.

### One set of beliefs per repo

Every document this integration writes carries provenance tags — `source:chat`, `harness:<id>`,
`knowledge:<kind>`, plus anything from `retainTags`. Those tags say **who wrote** a memory; they are
what filters recall and draws each document's agent logo, and they stay on the facts.

They are not, however, a good boundary for
[observations](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/developer/observations). Consolidation's own
default (`combined`) builds one observation set per distinct tag set, so the same repository
worked on by two agents would grow two parallel sets of beliefs — one per harness — that never
merge, each blind to the other, at double the consolidation cost. Which agent happened to be typing
does not change whether a convention or a decision is true.

So the integration retains with `observationScopes: "shared"`: one global, untagged observation
scope per bank, which is what a bank already is — one project's memory. Set the field to change it:

```jsonc
{
  "observationScopes": "combined", // one observation set per distinct tag set (server default)
  "banks": {
    "coding-agent::mono": { "observationScopes": "per_tag" }, // per-repo, like any behavioral field
  },
}
```

### Splitting code from conversation — `per_source`

`shared` puts every document a repo produces into one belief set. `"per_source"` keeps that set and
adds one per origin, so "what the commits say" and "what was decided in conversation" can be asked
apart:

```jsonc
{ "observationScopes": "per_source" }
```

Each document consolidates into the global scope **plus** one named for each `source:` tag it
carries — `[[], ["source:chat"]]` for a session transcript, `[[], ["source:git"]]` for a commit
diff. Read an axis back with `tags: ["source:git"], tags_match: "exact"`, and the merged view with
`tags: [], tags_match: "exact"`.

A document carrying two `source:` tags gets a scope for each, and that is deliberate rather than
duplication. The commit-message seed is tagged `source:git` and `source:git-log`, so
`source:git-log` is fed only by the seed — what the commit _messages_ say — while `source:git` also
collects every per-commit diff under `gitIngest: "full"`. Two questions, two answers, each
deduplicated within itself by consolidation. A fact belonging to more than one axis is the point.

This cannot be expressed as a scope list. The server treats an explicit `list[list[str]]` as
unconditional — it is not filtered against the memory's own tags — so a configured
`[[], ["source:git"], ["source:chat"]]` writes every document into all three, and the `source:git`
scope fills with beliefs built from chat transcripts. Only a per-document decision separates them.

It costs one extra consolidation pass per document, and it reads only `source:`, so a volatile
provenance tag never becomes a scope. The global scope is still written first and unchanged, so the
untagged observations knowledge pages read are unaffected.

`"per_tag"` and `"all_combinations"` split further still, and an explicit `[["project:demo"], …]`
declares the scopes literally. `HINDSIGHT_OBSERVATION_SCOPES` sets the scalar modes; a scope list is
file-only. Changing this does not rewrite observations already consolidated under the old scoping —
they stay where they were built, and new work accrues under the new setting.

## Diagnostics & logging

All logs live in `~/.hindsight/coding-agents-logs/` (owner-only). Each file rotates to `<file>.1`
at 10 MB.

**Leveled plugin log** (humans debugging): `~/.hindsight/coding-agents-logs/plugin.log` (override
`HINDSIGHT_LOG_FILE`) — timestamped `LEVEL [scope] message` lines from every component, including
the ingestion engine. Level defaults to `info`; set `"logLevel": "debug"` in config or
`HINDSIGHT_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for ad-hoc debugging (at `debug`, every diag event below is mirrored
here too, so one file tells the whole story).

**Structured diag events** (machines/harnesses): every reflect and page-fetch outcome is appended
as a JSON line to `~/.hindsight/coding-agents-logs/diag.jsonl` (override with
`HINDSIGHT_DIAG_FILE`):

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-07-27T07:05:52Z",
  "harness": "claude-code",
  "event": "reflect_ok",
  "ms": 14210,
  "chars": 792,
  "query": "..."
}
```

`reflect_failed` / `pages_failed` record the error; if you're comparing memory-on vs memory-off,
check this file — a run whose reflects failed is a no-memory run. When the failure was a timeout or
a 5xx, the hook falls back to knowledge-page search and, if no page matches, to a raw recall of the
bank's memories: `reflect_fallback_pages` / `reflect_fallback_observations` record what each
step returned (`*_failed` when it errored). Seed starts are logged as
`seed_started`.

When `autoInject` names a retrieval source instead of reflect, that source records its own
outcome with the number of items it returned: `inject_pages` for `"pages"`, `inject_recall` for
`"recall"` (`inject_pages_failed` / `inject_recall_failed` when the call errored). No reflect
event is written on those turns — nothing reflected.

**Tool usage** (is the agent using Hindsight?): one JSON line per finished user turn in
`~/.hindsight/coding-agents-logs/usage.jsonl` (override `HINDSIGHT_USAGE_FILE`) — the `hindsight_*`
tools the agent called during that turn, and whether its reply credited Hindsight memory ("From
Hindsight memory"). The credit rate counts only turns that called a retrieval tool (search, list,
read, reflect); saving a document is not expected to be credited. Recorded when the session is written back, so a scope with
`retainSessions: false` records none. It never leaves your machine. Summarize it per agent with:

```bash
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents stats
```

### Is the memory ready yet?

`hindsight_sync_status` — the agent-facing tool, `dist/status.js` for scripts — answers exactly
that: `"synced": true` means the seeded memory is queryable. It also reports gitlog freshness, how
far per-commit deepening has got, the codebase survey's state (`surveyBaseline` is the HEAD the last
survey started from, `surveyDocs` counts the findings documents that have landed, 0–4 — a baseline
with no findings retries automatically), and the extraction operations still in flight.

### Resetting a repo's memory

Delete its bank on the server. The bank is the **only** state this integration keeps, so the next
session in that repo is a true first open — seed and survey run again from scratch. There are no
client-side files to clean up.

### Marker documents you may notice

Two document ids exist for the machinery's own bookkeeping. Both are safe to ignore and safe to
delete:

- `survey-baseline:<sha>` — reads "🛰️ researching…" while a codebase survey runs and flips to
  "✅ completed" once its findings land. It is retained under the `survey` strategy, whose marker
  rule extracts **nothing** from a status marker, and it drives the re-survey cadence
  (`surveyRefreshCommits`) and `surveyBaseline` in sync status.
- `gitlog:<repo>` — the aggregated commit-message seed document, re-upserted rather than duplicated
  when the seed runs again.

### When memory seems to be missing

Failures never break the agent: a reflect, page fetch or retain that fails degrades to an ordinary
memoryless turn and is recorded in the logs. "No memory" is therefore a log question — check the
diag file for whether `session_start` and `deepen_started` ever fired for that bank. A session that
was already running when the plugin was installed has no SessionStart behind it; its first prompt
after the install self-heals.
